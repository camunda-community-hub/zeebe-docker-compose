# ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
# In order to activate the settings in this file, please choose one of the following ways:
# a) rename this file to application.yaml
# b) remove the *.template suffix and
#      Set the following environment variable: export SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION='file:./config/broker.yaml'
#      Alternatively, you can also pass it as a command line argument: ./bin/broker --spring.config.location=file:./config/broker.yaml

# Overview -------------------------------------------

# This file contains a complete list of available configuration options.

# This file shows example values for configuring several exporters. To enable an exporter
# please uncomment the whole block and overwrite the settings.

# Conventions:
#
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with KB = Kilobytes, MB = Megabytes or GB = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16MB" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified either in the standard ISO-8601 format used
# by java.time.Duration, or as strings with the following format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 5, 10, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the broker.
# ----------------------------------------------------

# zeebe:
  # broker:
    # Sets the timeout for each start and closing step.
    #
    # Broker bootstrap and closing is divided in several individual steps.
    # Each step should take at max the defined stepTimeout, otherwise the bootstrap is aborted.
    #
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_STEPTIMEOUT.
    # stepTimeout: 5m

    # gateway:
      # Enable the embedded gateway to start on broker startup.
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_ENABLE.
      # enable: false

    # network:
      # This section contains the network configuration. Particularly, it allows to
      # configure the hosts and ports the broker should bind to. The broker exposes three sockets:
      # 1. command: the socket which is used for gateway-to-broker communication
      # 2. internal: the socket which is used for broker-to-broker communication
      # 3. monitoring: the socket which is used to monitor the broker

      # Controls the default host the broker should bind to. Can be overwritten on a
      # per binding basis for client, management and replication
      #
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_HOST.
      # host: 0.0.0.0

      # Controls the advertised host; if omitted defaults to the host. This is particularly useful if your
      # broker stands behind a proxy.
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_ADVERTISEDHOST.
      # advertisedHost: 0.0.0.0

      # If a port offset is set it will be added to all ports specified in the config
      # or the default values. This is a shortcut to not always specifying every port.
      #
      # The offset will be added to the second last position of the port, as Zeebe
      # requires multiple ports. As example a portOffset of 5 will increment all ports
      # by 50, i.e. 26500 will become 26550 and so on.
      #
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_PORTOFFSET.
      # portOffset: 0

      # Sets the maximum size of the incoming and outgoing messages (i.e. commands and events).
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_MAXMESSAGESIZE.
      # maxMessageSize: 4MB

      # commandApi:
        # Overrides the host used for gateway-to-broker communication
        # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_COMMANDAPI_HOST.
        # host: 0.0.0.0

        # Sets the port used for gateway-to-broker communication
        # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_COMMANDAPI_PORT.
        # port: 26501

      # internalApi:
        # Overrides the host used for internal broker-to-broker communication
        # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_INTERNALAPI_HOST.
        # host: 0.0.0.0

        # Sets the port used for internal broker-to-broker communication
        # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_INTERNALAPI_PORT.
        # port: 26502

      # monitoringApi:
        # Overrides the host used for exposing monitoring information
        # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_MONITORINGAPI_HOST.
        # host: 0.0.0.0

        # Sets the port used for exposing monitoring information
        # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_NETWORK_MONITORINGAPI_PORT.
        # port: 9600

    # data:
      # This section allows to configure Zeebe's data storage. Data is stored in
      # "partition folders". A partition folder has the following structure:
      #
      # partition-0                       (root partition folder)
      # ├── partition.json                (metadata about the partition)
      # ├── segments                      (the actual data as segment files)
      # │   ├── 00.data
      # │   └── 01.data
      # └── state                     	(stream processor state and snapshots)
      #     └── stream-processor
      #		  ├── runtime
      #		  └── snapshots

      # Specify a list of directories in which data is stored. Using multiple
      # directories makes sense in case the machine which is running Zeebe has
      # multiple disks which are used in a JBOD (just a bunch of disks) manner. This
      # allows to get greater throughput in combination with a higher io thread count
      # since writes to different disks can potentially be done in parallel.
      #
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_DIRECTORIES.
      # directories: [ data ]

      # The size of data log segment files.
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_LOGSEGMENTSIZE.
      # logSegmentSize: 512MB

      # How often we take snapshots of streams (time unit)
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_SNAPSHOTPERIOD.
      # snapshotPeriod: 15m

    # cluster:
      # This section contains all cluster related configurations, to setup a zeebe cluster

      # Specifies the unique id of this broker node in a cluster.
      # The id should be between 0 and number of nodes in the cluster (exclusive).
      #
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_NODEID.
      # nodeId: 0

      # Controls the number of partitions, which should exist in the cluster.
      #
      # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_PARTITIONSCOUNT.
      # partitionsCount: 1

      # Controls the replication factor, which defines the count of replicas per partition.
      # The replication factor cannot be greater than the number of nodes in the cluster.
      #
      # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_REPLICATIONFACTOR.
      # replicationFactor: 1

      # Specifies the zeebe cluster size. This value is used to determine which broker
      # is responsible for which partition.
      #
      # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_CLUSTERSIZE.
      # clusterSize: 1

      # Allows to specify a list of known other nodes to connect to on startup
      # The contact points of the internal network configuration must be specified.
      # The format is [HOST:PORT]
      # Example:
      # initialContactPoints : [ 192.168.1.22:26502, 192.168.1.32:26502 ]
      #
      # To guarantee the cluster can survive network partitions, all nodes must be specified
      # as initial contact points.
      #
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_INITIALCONTACTPOINTS
      # specifying a comma-separated list of contact points.
      # Default is empty list:
      # initialContactPoints: []

      # Allows to specify a name for the cluster
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_CLUSTERNAME.
      # Example:
      # clusterName: zeebe-cluster

    # threads:
      # Controls the number of non-blocking CPU threads to be used. WARNING: You
      # should never specify a value that is larger than the number of physical cores
      # available. Good practice is to leave 1-2 cores for ioThreads and the operating
      # system (it has to run somewhere). For example, when running Zeebe on a machine
      # which has 4 cores, a good value would be 2.
      #
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_THREADS_CPUTHREADCOUNT
      # cpuThreadCount: 2

      # Controls the number of io threads to be used. These threads are used for
      # workloads that write data to disk. While writing, these threads are blocked
      # which means that they yield the CPU.
      #
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_THREADS_IOTHREADCOUNT
      # ioThreadCount: 2

    # exporters:
      # Configure exporters below
      #
      # Each exporter should be configured following this template:
      #
      # jarPath:
      #   path to the JAR file containing the exporter class. JARs are only loaded once, so you can define
      #   two exporters that point to the same JAR, with the same class or a different one, and use args
      #   to parametrize its instantiation.
      # className:
      #   entry point of the exporter, a class which *must* extend the io.zeebe.exporter.Exporter
      #   interface.
      #
      # A nested table as "args:" will allow you to inject arbitrary arguments into your
      # class through the use of annotations.
      #
      # These setting can also be overridden using the environment variables "ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_[exporter name]_..."
      #

      # Debug Log Exporter --------------
